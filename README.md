# transcodarr
Transcodarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr, forked from Bazarr. It manages and transcodes video files based on your requirements. You define your preferences by TV show or movies and Bazarr takes care of everything for you.

Similar to Bazarr, Transcodarr doesn't scan disk to detect series and movies: It only takes care of the series and movies that are indexed in Sonarr and Radarr.
